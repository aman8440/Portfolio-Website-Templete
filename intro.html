            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For science,
               music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar, their
               pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone realizes why a new common language would be
               desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators. To achieve this, it would be necessary to have
               uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words. If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the
               resulting language is more simple and regular than that of the individual languages. The new common
               language will be more simple and regular than the existing European languages. It will be as simple as
               Occidental; in fact, it will be Occidental. To an English person, it will seem like simplified English,
               as a skeptical Cambridge friend of mine told me what Occidental is.</p>
